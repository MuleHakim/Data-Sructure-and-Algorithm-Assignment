## I have implemented quick sort by using five (5) methods with space complexity of O(n^2)

| No  |                Method                                     
|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------
|  1  |   By picking the first element as pivot.                      
|  2  |   By picking the middle element in the unsorted array as pivot
|  3  |   By picking the last element as pivot                         
|  4  |   By picking a random element as pivot.                        
|  5  |   By picking median as pivot
